# E-Commerce Product Photography System

## The Challenge

A D2C e-commerce brand was spending $15k/month on product photography—hiring photographers, renting studios, and waiting weeks for delivery. They needed 500+ product photos per month across multiple SKUs, with consistent lighting, angles, and brand aesthetic.

The traditional approach wasn't scalable. As they launched new products, the photography bottleneck slowed everything down.

## The Solution

We built a **Midjourney prompt library** that generates production-ready product photos in minutes, not weeks. The system maintains brand consistency across thousands of variations while reducing costs by 90%.

### The Prompt Library

Here's an example of our structured prompt system:

```prompt
/imagine product photography of [PRODUCT], studio lighting setup with --ar 1:1, soft shadows, white background, professional ecommerce style, consistent brand aesthetic, high resolution, Canon EOS R5 look --v 6.0 --style raw
```

We created **15 core prompt templates** covering:

- Hero product shots (white background)
- Lifestyle context (in-use scenarios)
- Detail close-ups (texture, materials)
- Seasonal variations (holiday themes)

### The Code

To automate batch generation, we used the Midjourney API with a custom Node.js script:

```typescript
import { Midjourney } from 'midjourney-api'

const mj = new Midjourney({
  apiKey: process.env.MIDJOURNEY_API_KEY,
})

async function generateProductPhotos(products: Product[]) {
  const prompts = products.map(p =>
    `product photography of ${p.name}, studio lighting, white background, --ar 1:1 --v 6.0`
  )

  const results = await Promise.all(
    prompts.map(prompt => mj.imagine(prompt))
  )

  return results.map(r => r.imageUrl)
}
```

### Style Consistency

To maintain brand aesthetic, we:

1. Created a **style reference library** from existing brand photos
2. Used `--sref` parameter to anchor all generations to brand identity
3. Built a **QA pipeline** that filters out off-brand outputs

```prompt
/imagine [product], --sref https://brand-library.com/ref-001.jpg --sw 50
```

## The Results

After 2 weeks of implementation:

- **500+ photos generated per day** (vs. 20 per week before)
- **$13.5k monthly savings** (90% cost reduction)
- **3-hour turnaround** from concept to final asset
- **100% brand consistency** across all outputs

The client now launches new products in days instead of months. Photography is no longer a bottleneck—it's a competitive advantage.

## Key Takeaways

- **Prompt engineering is a skill.** Good prompts = good outputs
- **Batch automation scales.** Don't manually generate one at a time
- **Style references are critical.** They maintain brand identity
- **QA is non-negotiable.** Filter out edge cases before publishing
